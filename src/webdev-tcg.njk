        <h4>Web Development with The Coders Guild</h4>
      <p>
        This 16 week bootcamp delving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided me with a strong foundation into web
        development.  I gained a deep respect and admiration for coders once I myself 
        went through the intricate process of coding and knew that is what I wanted to immerse myself into. I've documented
        my learning process with TCG under the 'Blog' section and you can read all about the code I've written during 
        this course. Aside from the coding aspect, I'm fully comfortable using GitHub and Netlify to deploy websites and adding
        and testing features using branches. I can also deploy static sites using Eleventy and this portfolio is a good example
        of this! I was instantly gripped within the first few weeks and by the end of it now, I'm ready
        to take my learning into the working world.
