        <h4>Python with Code First Girls</h4>
        <p>I took part in a 8-week long Python Kickstarted bootcamp where I learned the fundamentals of Python and by 
            the end I created my own program. The program I created was a recipe finder which takes in an ingredient input
            from the user and searches the Edamam API for recipes with that ingredient and lists them out to the user.
